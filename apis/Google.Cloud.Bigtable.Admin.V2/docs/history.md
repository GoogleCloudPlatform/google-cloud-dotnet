# Version history

# Version 2.0.0-beta01, released 2020-02-17

This is the first prerelease targeting GAX v3. Please see the [breaking changes
guide](https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-dotnet/docs/guides/breaking-gax2.html)
for details of changes to both GAX and code generation.

Note that snapshot-based RPCs are now exposed in the admin client,
despite being documented as alpha APIs. These were previously
disabled by configuration, but that configuration is not present
in the new generator. If these methods are ever removed, we'll
create a new major version.
