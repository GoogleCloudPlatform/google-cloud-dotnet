    <summary>
      Sets or removes one or more labels on {target}.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Each entry in <paramref name="labels"/> is treated as a label to set or remove. If the value is null,
      it will be removed from the dataset; otherwise, it will be set/added. Labels which do not have an entry
      in the dictionary will be ignored.
    </remarks>
    <returns>
      A dictionary with the same keys as <paramref name="labels"/>, and values indicating the corresponding label value
      before this operation completed. Labels which weren't present on the dataset before the modification have corresponding
      null values in the returned dictionary.
    </returns>
