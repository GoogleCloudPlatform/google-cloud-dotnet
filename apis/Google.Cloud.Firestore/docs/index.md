# Getting started

Everything starts with [FirestoreDb](obj/api/Google.Cloud.Firestore.FirestoreDb.yml).
Create an instance using the `Create` or `CreateAsync` methods, passing in your Google Cloud project ID.
The default credentials will be used to authenticate with the server.

From there, you can create, fetch and modify documents, and run queries.
