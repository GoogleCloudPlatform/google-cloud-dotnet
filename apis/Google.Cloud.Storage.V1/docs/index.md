# Getting started

Common operations are exposed via the
[StorageClient](obj/api/Google.Cloud.Storage.V1.StorageClient.yml) class.

# Client life-cycle management

In many cases you don't need to worry about disposing of
`StorageClient` objects, and can create them reasonably freely -
but be aware that this *can* causes issues with memory and network
connection usage. We advise you to reuse a single client object if
possible; if your architecture requires you to frequently create new
client objects, please dispose of them to help with timely resource
clean-up. See [the resource clean-up guide](../guides/cleanup.html#rest-based-apis) for more
details.

# Sample code

## Signed URLs

Signed URLs can be created to provide limited access to specific buckets and
objects to anyone in possession of the URL, regardless of whether they have
a Google account.

For example, Signed URLs can be created to provide read-only access to
existing objects:

[!code-cs[](obj/snippets/Google.Cloud.Storage.V1.UrlSigner.txt#SignedURLGet)]

Or write-only access to put specific object content into a bucket:

[!code-cs[](obj/snippets/Google.Cloud.Storage.V1.UrlSigner.txt#SignedURLPut)]

## Upload URIs

In some cases, it may not make sense for client applications to have permissions
to begin an upload for an object, but an authenticated service may choose to grant
this ability for individual uploads. Signed URLs are one option for this. Another
option is for the service to start a resumable upload session, but instead of
performing the upload, sending the resulting upload URI to the client application
so it can perform the upload instead. Unlike sessions initiated with a signed URL,
a pre-initated upload session will force the client application to upload through
the region in which the session began, which will likely be close to the service,
and not necessarily the client.

## Customer-supplied encryption keys

Storage objects are always stored encrypted, but if you wish to
specify your own encryption key instead of using the server-supplied
one, you can do so either for all operations with a particular
`StorageClient` or on individual ones.

## Change notification via Google Cloud Pub/Sub

You can configure a bucket to send a change notification to a
[Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) topic
when changes occur. The sample below shows how to create a Pub/Sub
topic, set its permissions so that the change notifications can be
published to it, and then create the notification configuration on a
bucket. You'll need to add a dependency on the
`Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1` NuGet package to create the topic and
manage its permissions.
