# Google Cloud .NET Client
.NET idiomatic client libraries for [Google Cloud Platform][cloud-platform] services.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-dotnet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-dotnet)

* [Homepage][language-landing-dotnet]
* [API Documentation][api-reference-dotnet]

This client supports the following Google Cloud Platform services:

* [Google BigQuery](#google-bigquery)
* [Google Cloud Datastore](#google-cloud-datastore)
* [Google Cloud Storage](#google-cloud-storage)
* [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](#google-cloud-pubsub)
* [Google Cloud Logging](#google-cloud-logging-beta)

> Note: This client is a work-in-progress, and may occasionally
> make backwards-incompatible changes. The layout of the repository
> is likely to change, and names (of everything - assemblies,
> namespaces, types, members...) should be regarded as provisional.

If you need support for other Google APIs, check out the [Google .NET API Client library][google-api-dotnet-client].

## Example Applications

* [getting-started-dotnet] - A [quickstart and tutorial][language-landing-dotnet] that demonstrates how to build a complete web application using Cloud Datastore, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Pub/Sub and deploy it to Google App Engine or Google Compute Engine.

## Requirements

In order to build the code in this repository, you will need
to [install DNVM][dnvm]. You do not need DNVM to use the code,
provided as NuGet packages.

Most projects in this repository require [gRPC], which has a
component written in native code. Using that component from DNX
currently [requires a workaround][grpc-workaround]; on Windows please run `fix_dnx_grpc.bat`
before running any gRPC code.

## Authentication
