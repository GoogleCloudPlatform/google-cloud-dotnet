# Processes, release procedures etc

This repository includes multiple projects at multiple versions,
some of which depend on each other. That makes things tricky, and
leads to rather more complicated procedures than a simple "single
package" repository. Please read this guide carefully to understand
how releases happen, and why they happen that way.

## The API catalog

Only the source within the `apis` directory is published, although not
every project within that directory is published.
(There are test projects and tools alongside the production code.)
Nothing in the `tools` directory is published as a package.

Most project files under `apis` are at least partially generated.
The master information is in [apis.json](apis/apis.json) - the API
catalog file. There's an entry for each API, containing:

- The kind of API (grpc, rest, other)
- The version number
- A product title and home page for documentation
- Dependencies
- Additional test project dependencies
- Target framework versions
- Package description for NuGet
- Tags for NuGet (in addition to default ones)

The catalog is used to generate project files and also during the
release process described below. Running the project generator is
very simple: from the root directory, in a bash shell, run

```bash
./generateprojects.sh
```

The CI systems run this before building, to ensure that the project
files are in a stable state.

Generating the project files allows for broad changes (such as
adding Source Link support) to be made very simply, just by changing
the generator. Modifying every project file by hand simply doesn't
scale.

However, sometimes manual editing of project files is required. The
project generator supports this by assuming it "owns":

- The first `PropertyGroup` element (for general properties)
- The first `ItemGroup` element (for dependencies)
- The `ItemGroup` element for Source Link (with a label of "dotnet pack instructions")
- The common import to only attempt to build desktop assemblies on Windows

Any other elements are left as they are - so if you wish to add an
`ItemGroup` such as for file grouping, just add it anywhere after
the generated one, and it should do the right thing.

Additionally, for each API, the project generator adds all projects
under the API directory (and project references) to the solution for
that API. It will create project files from scratch as well - so when adding a
new package from autogenerated API sources, the simplest approach is
to copy the source files, modify the API catalog, and run the
project generator. The project files and solution file will be
generated and should immediately be usable.

## Versioning

All releasable packages follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).
Non-releasable code (tests, tools, analyzers) are not versioned. The
precise meaning of a breaking change (dictating version number
increments) is out of the scope of this document. (Jon is writing a
blog post about this topic and will link to it when it is published.)

The version number in the API catalog (and therefore in project
files) is one of:

- The mostly recently released package version
- The version that's *about* to be released (see below)
- A prerelease with a suffix of 00 to indicate that the *next* release
  should be the first prerelease for that major/minor version.

The last of these cases can happen if either an existing version has
gone to GA and new features have been merged since (to ensure that
we don't add features within a minor GA version) or for brand-new
APIs that haven't been released at all. The tooling for tagging is
aware of this convention, and doesn't create tags for `alpha00` or
`beta00` suffixes.

Typically version numbers should be changed in a commit which does
nothing else, for clarity. Include both the `apis.json` change and
the project file changes that occur when the project generator has
been run, in the same commit.

Dependencies in the API catalog are specified as properties where
the property name is the package name and the value is the version
number.

If the version number is set to "project", then a project reference
is used.

If the version number is set to "default", then the version number
is determined by the project generator, to keep these dependencies
in sync for all appropriate packages. This is not permitted for GA
releases (i.e. ones with no alpha or beta suffix), as we need a
clear record of the dependencies in that case. For example, if the
most recent release is 2.3.1 against gRPC 1.7.0, it's fine to make
2.3.2 depend on 1.7.1, but depending on gRPC 1.8.0 would require a
new minor version (2.4.0).

## Releasing

Releasing consists of five steps:

- Updating the version number in GitHub (via standard pull requests)
- Creating a release tag and GitHub release
- Building and testing
- Pushing the package to nuget.org
- Updating the documentation in GitHub (in the `gh-pages` branch)

### Current process

- After the version number is committed, run `tagreleases.sh` from the
  root directory to tag all updated versions.
- Run `buildrelease.sh` manually, specifying the commit that was
  tagged. (`tagreleases.sh` outputs the command line to run)
- Go into the `releasebuild/nuget` directory and push
- Make sure you have a clone of the gh-pages branch, copy the
  documentation from `releasebuild/docs/output/assembled` as the new
  `docs` directory in the `gh-pages branch, commit and push.

Note that `tagreleases.sh` checks that there are no project
references from APIs being released now to APIs that *aren't* being
released. Without this check, it's possible for a released version
to depend on unreleased changes.

### Future process

- Commit the new versions as before
- Run `tagreleases.sh` as before
- A build machine picks up the tags and performs all the remaining
  steps with no manual intervention
